========== XDNS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ==========

To enable administrator privileges for XDNS (required for changing DNS settings),
please follow these simple steps after installation:

1. Open Notepad as administrator (right-click on Notepad and select "Run as administrator")

2. Copy and paste the following code into Notepad:
   
   @echo off
   echo Requesting administrative privileges...
   echo Set UAC = CreateObject^("Shell.Application"^) > "%temp%\getadmin.vbs"
   echo UAC.ShellExecute "%~dp0XDNS.exe", "", "", "runas", 1 >> "%temp%\getadmin.vbs"
   "%temp%\getadmin.vbs"
   if exist "%temp%\getadmin.vbs" (del "%temp%\getadmin.vbs")
   exit

3. Save this file as "RunXDNS.bat" in the same folder where XDNS.exe is installed 
   (typically in "C:\Program Files\XDNS" or similar location)

4. Right-click on the created RunXDNS.bat file and select "Create shortcut"

5. Move the shortcut to your desktop or any location you prefer

6. Use this shortcut to run XDNS with administrator privileges automatically

========== WHY THIS IS NECESSARY ==========

Windows requires administrator privileges to change DNS settings. The above batch 
file automatically requests these privileges when you run the application, so you 
don't need to right-click and select "Run as administrator" each time.

========== TROUBLESHOOTING ==========

If you encounter any issues:
- Make sure the path in the shortcut correctly points to the XDNS installation folder
- Try running the application as administrator manually by right-clicking XDNS.exe
- Check that your Windows user account has administrator privileges
